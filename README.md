username explanation: shortened version of my standard username schrodinger1cat almost everywhere, su(1) is the special unitary group and dev because, and this might be a bit,,, surprising, im a developer!

hi! i do coding and studying stuff. the current projects im working on are:

1. TreasureTrove - overengineered CLI-based to-do list thats trying really hard, and failing, to be a social platform
2. Margins (and its subproject Textbook DLC) - textbook annotation website because math is confusing. Textbook DLC only exists for when the textbooks on Margins get (inevitably) copystruck and so all the annotations get migrated to... a Word doc, basically.
3.Solutionbook (yes, generic, i know) - books of solutions to textbooks which dont have solutions, aka me overengineering Margins (again)
4.Trying to not lose my sanity!

none of the above are available yet, (especially not #4. god knows i am on the verge of dropping out.) but luckily i'll be speedrunning developing Margins for my thesis project. it's due june 2025 so stay tuned my friends, enemies, and those who have yet to become either :3

is this readme cring af? yea kinda. do i regret every single one of my decisions as a programmer? of course, who doesnt. but

yea i dont have a but

how do i end this mesage
